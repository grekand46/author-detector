This year, My Arcade seems ready to go all in on the Atari GameStation branding. Beyond the GameStation Go, the company announced a $50 wireless GameStation Gamepad, a $70 GameStation Arcade Stick, and a $250 GameStation Mega tabletop arcade cabinet (with a 10.1-inch display). All four GameStation products feature a trackball, spinner, and number pad for maximum control authenticity, as well as helpful accent lighting that highlights which controls are active on a per-game basis—handy for younger gamers who might be overwhelmed by all the different control options.

In a hands-on video from CES, YouTuber GenXGrownUp shows off a preliminary GameStation Go game list, including the usual mix of well over 100 Atari 2600/5200/7800 and classic Atari arcade games you might expect from this kind of retro product (though it's almost criminal not to see Marble Madness listed among the trackball-supported games). And despite the Atari name, the game selection on hand also includes many licensed NES and Super NES era titles from Jaleco: Bases Loaded, modern retro-styled titles from Piko Interactive, themed virtual pinball tables from Atari's Balls of Steel line, and even Namco's Pac-Man (why not?).

Atari's modernized Centipede Recharged is also included in the game lineup, and GenXGrownUp reports that more Recharged games will be included with downloadable firmware updates after launch (which he says is "more than six months away"). Players will also seemingly be able to update the firmware through an SD card slot atop the GameStation Go, though it's unclear whether you'll be able to load your own ROMs in the same way (at least officially).

Despite including a numpad like the Intellivision controller, the GameStation Go doesn't currently include any games from Atari's recently purchased Intellivision library. But GenXGrownUp says including those titles—alongside Atari Lynx and Jaguar games—is not "off the table yet" for the final release.

We can only hope that the Gamestation line will show a pent-up demand for these esoteric retro control options, leading to similar modular options for the Nintendo Switch or its coming successor. How about it, Nintendo?
